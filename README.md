# ETL-use-case-using-python-
This Python project encompasses the complete Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process for a bicycle store. It retrieves data from various sources such as databases, data lakes, and APIs, conducts thorough quality checks, transforms the data as needed, and finally loads it into the target destination.

1-Extraction: Data is collected from various sources like databases, data lakes, and APIs using tailored methods. Dedicated notebooks or scripts manage this extraction process.
2-Transformation: Extracted data is transformed based on predefined rules and requirements. Tasks include merging datasets, calculating new columns, and creating lookup tables. This stage is managed by notebooks or scripts specific to data transformation.
3-Loading: Transformed data is loaded into the target destination, often an Information Mart, which typically is a database or data warehouse. This step involves loading cleaned and processed data efficiently. Notebooks or scripts are dedicated to data loading processes.
